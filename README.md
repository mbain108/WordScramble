Hacking with Swift (Paul Hudson)

In this project I produced a word game that deals with anagrams.

Some things covered: ~ a little bit more about UITableView: how to reload their data and how to insert rows
 ~ how to add text fields to UIAlertController so that you can accept user input
 ~ more about Swift strings
 ~ closures
 ~ method return values ~ booleans ~ NSRange
